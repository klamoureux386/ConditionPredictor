# throwaway words that are common parts of 
# negex regular expressions but do not serve as
# efficient lookups.  
# Good candidates are modifiers  used in regular expressions where there's another version
# or common words that could never stand alone as a negation trigger
# the more words we can put here, the faster Negex will run
# for example there are two regexes  "absence of"  and "free of"  In the inverted  lookup mechanism, there would be entries for 
# "of","absence","free" where "of" contained two regex expressions and triggered two attempts.   By removing "of" using the list
# below, we can get to the appropriate regex for a sentence with "absence of" or "free of" in the first hit.
