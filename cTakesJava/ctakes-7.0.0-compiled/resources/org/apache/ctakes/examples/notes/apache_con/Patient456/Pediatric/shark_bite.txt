Billy Johnson is presenting signs of a shark bite.  It occurred last week and has caused immense leg pain.  The pain was so severe that he had begun taking narcotics to relieve it.

The patient was concerned about his dreams of playing professional baseball.

After imaging which was inconclusive, the patient was released to go home and treat his pain himself.
